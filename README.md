## Overveiw:
* After my inital commit to Heroku I fogired out that all of my styling was done inccorectly. in which I had to start again. I had originaly had downloaded a cool npm package that allowed for PDF displays, but noticed that the requirements wanted a list instead. But after many failed attemtpts I finaly got all of my styling onto Heroku.
